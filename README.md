# text-generator.gpt
Text Generator is a Python project that uses the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to generate meaningful text continuations based on user input. Users can input a sentence, which is then tokenized and processed by the GPT-2 model to produce a coherent continuation using techniques like beam search for improved quality.


## Features

- Input a sentence and receive a coherent text continuation.
- Utilizes beam search to improve the quality of generated text.
- Supports various input lengths and generates outputs of customizable lengths.



Key Components:
Tokenization: The input sentence is tokenized and encoded into input IDs.
Text Generation: The model generates text based on the input IDs, using beam search for better coherence.
Decoding: The generated output is decoded back into human-readable text.



- You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install tensorflow transformers
